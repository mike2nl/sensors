# sensors
It's all about sensor data sheets, calibration and / or resfresh routine informations.

We use them from the startup of electronics to get information around us or
an evoirement in there we live and work.

- Think about our water what we need to drink.
- Think about a hospital.
- Think about cars, planes, satellites or the space flights.
- Think about your credit card, finger and eye scanner.
- They are everywhere and we use them on daily base.

There are a lot of very good projects around the world and here on github and
they need external information to do something with that. Data collection,
investigation and analysis.

This site wants to provide data sheets, wiring diagrams and routines to handle them.
Not all sensors are the same, some of them are very expensive and some cheaper models.

There are some categories we can place them:
- DIY (do-it-yourself) sensors for home projects.
- Sensor for consumer electronics (coffe machine, ...).
- Medical grade to control human conditions
- Industrial grade for controlling machines and processes.
- Last but not least the off shore, aironautics and space envoiremnet.

We will start with the DIY sensors and work further up to get it done.

The most important things is the experience from the people outside and here on github
because this wants to be a source of sensor know-how as best as possible.
